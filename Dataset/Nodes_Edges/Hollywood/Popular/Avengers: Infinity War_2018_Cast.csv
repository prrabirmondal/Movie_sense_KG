tony stark,thor,"In 'Avengers: Infinity War', both Tony Stark and Thor are Avengers trying to keep the Earth safe from a greater threat approaching in the form of Thanos. As the king of Asgard, Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok where he is in a 'very profound' and 'very interesting place' with 'real emotional motivation'. The writers consulted with the director and screenwriter of Thor: Ragnarok to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film. Joe Russo revealed that Thor's storyline has 'the driving hero’s arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos’ argument'.
