nina,lily,"Nina worries that the role might be too much for her and tells them she is not well enough to perform, causing Lily to prepare to replace her. Later, Nina convinces Thomas to allow her to take back her role. However, during the ballet, Nina's hallucination distracts her and causes her to lose stability as Odette, leading to the male dancer dropping her on stage. This infuriates Thomas. In their dressing room, Nina confronts Lily preparing as Odile. During the fight, Lily transforms into Nina, and they break a mirror. Nina stabs herself with a large shard of glass from the mirror, thinking she has killed Lily. However, when Nina opens her door later, she finds Lily alive, apologizing for the misunderstanding and congratulating Nina before taking her leave. Nina realizes that she had stabbed herself instead.",e9a96ac4db424f18890e517a6129d7f7,4

nina,odette,"Nina, while performing the final act of the ballet, mistakenly stabs herself with a piece of glass, believing it to be Odette. She realizes her mistake and continues with the performance until the end, where Odette throws herself off a cliff. This is followed by Nina's landing on a mattress, portraying Odette's death. The audience applauds while Thomas, Lily, and others gather to congratulate Nina. However, as Thomas sees the spreading blood at Nina's waist, he becomes concerned and inquires about what happened to her. Nina calmly responds that she felt it was perfect.",01bde619598049f1b6ae6031711663c2,4
