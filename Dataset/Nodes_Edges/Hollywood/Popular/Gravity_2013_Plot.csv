space shuttle explorer,international space station (iss),"Explorer crew and ISS crew communicate regularly through Mission Control in Houston. Explorer is en route to service the Hubble Space Telescope, but debris from a destroyed satellite forces them to return to Earth immediately. However, Explorer suffers catastrophic damage, and both Kowalski and Stone are stranded in space with limited time before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. They decide to use MMUs to reach the ISS, which is in orbit about 1,450 km away.",2e7181862ae84d1eb198f6bfe8178bc9,4
matthew 'matt' kowalski,dr. ryan stone,"Kowalski and Stone are crew members aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer on a mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. During a spacewalk, they encounter a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris caused by a destroyed satellite. Debris strikes both the Explorer and the Hubble, leaving Stone tumbling through space and forcing Kowalski to rescue her using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).",2e7181862ae84d1eb198f6bfe8178bc9,4
matthew 'matt' kowalski,international space station (iss),"As the two crew members from Explorer approach the ISS, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz vehicles. This suggests a communication and collaboration relationship between Kowalski and the ISS.",2e7181862ae84d1eb198f6bfe8178bc9,4

Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong. Unable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong.",5f71d6381cb5467faf4afc8d4bcec60f,4
