      "3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, co-written by Abhijat Joshi and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Adapted loosely from Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone,[5] the film stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi in the titular roles, marking their reunion three years after Rang De Basanti (2006), while Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya appear in pivotal roles. Narrated through two parallel dramas, one in the present and the other set ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under the Indian education system.[6][7][8] Produced by Chopra under the banner Vinod Chopra Films,[9][10] 3 Idiots incorporated real Indian inventions created by Remya Jose,[11] Mohammad Idris,[12] Jahangir Painter[13] and Sonam Wangchuk, the latter of whom also inspired Khan's character.[14] Upon its release on 25 December 2009, 3 Idiots received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed towards its direction, themes, humour, story, screenplay, soundtrack and performances of the cast and was a commercial success. It was also the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend in India, had the highest opening day collections for an Indian film up until that point, and also held the record for the highest net collections in the first week for a Hindi film. Eventually, it became one of the few Indian films at the time to become successful in East Asian markets such as China[15] and Japan,[16] eventually bringing its worldwide gross to ₹460 crore ($90 million)[a][17][18] — it was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time until 2013 and the highest grossing Indian film of the 2000s. At the 57th National Film Awards, 3 Idiots won 3 National Film Awards, including Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Additionally, the film received 11 nominations at the 55th Filmfare Awards, including Best Actor (Khan), Best Actress (Kapoor) and Best Supporting Actor (Madhavan and Joshi), and won a leading 6 awards (tying with Dev.D), including Best Film, Best Director (Hirani) and Best Supporting Actor (Irani). Overseas, it won the Grand Prize at Japan's Videoyasan Awards,[19][20][16] while it was nominated for Best Outstanding Foreign Language Film at the Japan Academy Awards[21][22] and Best Foreign Film at China's Beijing International Film Festival.[23] 3 Idiots is now considered to be among the greatest Indian films ever made.[24] The film also had a social impact on attitudes toward education in India,[25] as well as in other Asian countries such as China and South Korea.[7] It was remade in Tamil as Nanban (2012), which also received critical praise and commercial success.[26][27] A Mexican remake, 3 Idiotas, was also released in 2017.[28] Chatur Ramalingam, a successful vice-president, reminds his old college rivals Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi about a bet he made with their classmate and Chatur's nemesis Rancho ten years ago.  Chatur has returned to India to conclude a business deal with Phunsukh Wangdu, a famous inventor. The three go to Shimla to find Rancho, reminiscing about their time at the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. In college, Rancho was passionate about learning and often clashed with the strict college president, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (\"Virus\"). When a student named Joy Lobo is denied graduation by Virus for not submitting a project, Rancho tries to help finish his project for him but finds out that Joy has committed suicide by hanging. Rancho confronts Virus about the intense pressure on students, but Virus dismisses him. One night, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju crash a wedding party, not realising it is for Virus's daughter Mona. Mona's younger sister, Pia, is initially upset with Rancho but starts liking him after he exposes her materialistic fiancé Suhas. Pia breaks up with Suhas. Virus warns Farhan and Raju about associating with Rancho, so Raju moves in with Chatur, a competitive student who relies on rote learning. Rancho and Farhan prank Chatur by altering his Hindi speech, leading to his humiliation. Furious, Chatur challenges Rancho to see who is more successful in ten years. Before their final exams, Raju’s father has a heart attack. Rancho and Pia help save him. Virus bets Rancho that neither Farhan nor Raju will get a job after graduation. Rancho tells his friends why they struggle: Farhan's passion is photography, not engineering, and Raju lacks confidence. Farhan and Raju promise to confront their issues if Rancho confesses his feelings for Pia. They drunkenly break into Virus's house, and Farhan and Raju urinate on his letterbox. Virus notices Raju at his doorstep and threatens to expel him unless he betrays Rancho. Not wanting to disappoint his family or to betray Rancho, Raju attempts suicide but survives and is paralyzed and near catatonic for months, leading Virus to revoke the expulsion. After Raju recovers, he succeeds in the interview and gets a job, and Farhan convinces his father to let him become a photographer. Humiliated at Raju's success, Virus sets a difficult exam to fail Raju so he cannot claim the job. With Pia’s help, Rancho and Farhan steal the exam paper, but Raju refuses to cheat and throws it away. They are nonetheless caught and are all expelled. Following the trio's expulsion, Pia, having given the office key to the trio, finally confronts her older sister, Mona, and her father by revealing that her brother had actually committed suicide due to the pressure his father had put him through into becoming an engineer, since he wanted to pursue his own dream by becoming a writer instead, but only to simply write a suicide note. On a stormy night, a pregnant Mona goes into labour while unable to reach a hospital, but successfully delivers her baby with Rancho's, Farhan's and Raju's help. In gratitude, Virus forgives the three, reluctantly passing down his space pen to Rancho as a mark of honor. On graduation day, Rancho disappears. In the present, Farhan, Raju, and Chatur reach Shimla and find out that the real Rancho was a different man. Their friend was actually Chhote, the son of Rancho’s family's gardener, who took Rancho’s place to get an education and earn a degree for him. The real Rancho tells them Chhote’s address in Ladakh. On the way, they stop Pia’s wedding with Suhas in Manali and convince her to join them. In Ladakh, they find a school run by their friend. Chatur mocks Rancho, thinking he is merely a teacher, but is shocked to realize that he is actually Phunsukh Wangdu, the person he is eager to make a business deal with. Chatur accepts defeat, and the friends run away laughing. \"Chetan gave me this book to read and I wanted to make a film on it. But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project. But he was okay with it\". — Rajkumar Hirani, about the connection with the film and the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat[29] After the success of Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), the director Rajkumar Hirani and screenwriter Abhijat Joshi had plans for third instalment on the Munna Bhai franchise, titled Munnabhai Chale Amerika. But Hirani felt exhausted working on consecutive films on the same format, and decided to work on fresh script outside the franchise.[30] While writing the first draft of the film, he thought of a new project rather than the new instalment from the film series, but he had concentrated more on the project and then worked on the former first. While thinking about how the project coming under fruition, he got the popular novel Five Point Someone by the author Chetan Bhagat.[31] The latter gave this novel for Hirani to read, in order to have an idea about the script. Impressed by the novel, he decided to adapt the screenplay by making changes to the original novel and work on it as a feature film.[32] 3 Idiots is considered to be the first of the two adaptations from the novel Five Point Someone — the second being Kai Po Che! (2013), which also drew inspiration from the novel The 3 Mistakes of My Life written by Bhagat.[33] In the third collaboration with Hirani after the Munna Bhai film series: Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003) and Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), Vidhu Vinod Chopra produced the project under the production company Vinod Chopra Films (which earlier named Vinod Chopra Productions).[34] Besides producing, Chopra further associated with Hirani and Joshi, by co-writing the screenplay. In his biography Unscripted: Conversations on Life and Cinema, he discussed about the experiences as a co-writer being associated in the project.[34][35] An official announcement regarding the film was made during early-2008, after working in the script for more than one-and-a-half year.[36] During the pre-production, Hirani went to multiple engineering colleges, including those under the Indian Institutes of Technology in Mumbai and Delhi, to authenticate the lives of engineering students. He met many students and took pictures along with them. He needed the references for the clothes used, their looks and things they brought as many IIT-students were older than the fictional characters.[32] The film also had shared many anecdotes from his college life, since Hirani had used to study in hostel during his young period.[citation needed] Hirani had carefully looked upon the notion in the lives of engineering students, as there are few things apart from drugs, sex and violence. However, Hirani had said that the film plays a satirical take on social pressures under an Indian education system.[7][8] Apart from that, the film also addresses the issue of tussle between parents and children, but in a \"sugar-coated manner\".[citation needed] During the promotions of the film, Hirani stated that \"the film is completely different of the Munna Bhai film series; in terms of the characters, story and the environment. However, both the films fall in the same genre, where all three films are heartwarming stories with lovable characters making it feel good. Both films have true emotions in the heart, happiness, sadness and also leave a strong message to the audience in the ending that make us satisfy\".[32] The casting of the lead actors was considered to be \"complex\", according to Hirani.[32] He thought of many actors playing the lead roles, and also went on a six-month audition across the country; but thought of established actors playing the roles, since the film had two looks and the actors needed experience.[32] He had plans for Shah Rukh Khan playing the lead character, Ranchoddas Chanchad.[37] Hirani tried to rope Khan after the latter exited from the titular role Munna Bhai in the director's debut venture Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003), which was later essayed by Sanjay Dutt. However, Khan refused being a part of the film due to his prior commitments.[38][39] Ranbir Kapoor, then a relative newcomer, also declined the lead role, but agreed to a short cameo as Varun Sahastrabuddhe.[40][b]\n",
      "Aamir Khan was later finalised to play the lead role.[43] R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi were also finalised for the other two leads – Farhan and Raju.[44] Originally, the roles initially went to John Abraham and Saif Ali Khan, but the actors rejected the film due to date issues. Arshad Warsi, who also collaborated with Hirani in the two Munnai Bhai films, auditioned but could not take up the role.[44] Before R. Madhavan was cast, Bangalore-based Rajeev Ravindranathan shot for his character for two months before his scenes were removed in favour of casting a \"known face\". Ravindranathan later played a college senior.[45] \n",
      "On being questioned about casting older actors to play the titular college students, Hirani said in an interview to Rediff that \"the actors chosen have that quality which he wanted for the film apart from the body language, mannerisms and innocence portrayed on-screen\".[32] The team approached Sanjay Dutt, with whom Hirani worked in the Munna Bhai film series, to play the role of the main antagonist Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe, but for various reasons the role went to Boman Irani.[46] The character name was considered to be unique due to the look, lisp and mannerisms portrayed, and also got the nickname \"Virus\", as students give names to their professors and principals in their school and college life. For the preparation of his role, Boman wore costumes made of cheap fabric, designed by an old tailor who stitches clothes for Parsis in Dadar (North-Central Mumbai).[32] He wore the shirt with velcro attached, and a hook tie; with the same look, he attended the shoot to prepare for his role.[46] Initially, Boman was hesitant to act in that film and had recommended his co-actor Irrfan Khan for Viru Sahastrabuddhe, but his refusal prompted Boman to take up the role.[47] This was revealed by Boman after Khan's death in April 2020.[48] After talks with Kajol fell through,[49] Kareena Kapoor played the role of Pia Sahastrabuddhe, Rancho's (Aamir) love interest and a medical student.[32] While Hirani refused about the original casting for her role in the film in his interview,[32] it has been regarded that Anushka Sharma was originally considered for the role.[50] In April 2021, an old video of Anushka's audition for the film went viral on the internet.[51] Anushka, then a newcomer, shared monologues recited by Gracy Singh from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. for the audition process, supposing to be her debut in films, but was ultimately rejected by the producers.[52] She later made her debut in the Yash Raj Films' production Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), being cast opposite Shah Rukh Khan.[b] Omi Vaidya, an American actor, was cast for the role Chathur Ramalingam (Silencer)\".[53] Ali Fazal, then, a rookie actor, played a small role as Joy Lobo in the film.[54] While speaking about his role, Fazal stated that \"he went into depression as the character arc seemed to mirror a tragic real-life incident\".[55][c] Javed Jaffrey played a cameo appearance as the real Ranchoddas Chanchad.[56] The rehearsals for the film began prior to the shoot, followed by script reading and look tests.[57] After extensive pre-production works, principal photography for the film began on 28 July 2008, with scenes featuring the supporting cast being shot first.[58] On 29 August 2008, shooting for the key schedule began with the principal cast members.[36] The first scene was shot in an aircraft with Madhavan, which was the first shooting schedule for this film in Mumbai. The team left to Ladakh, for a 20-day schedule with the crew and cast comprising Khan and Kapoor.[36] The climax was being shot at the Pangong Tso lake in Ladakh.[59] The team took a break following Aamir Khan's activities in the promotions and post-production works of Ghajini (2008).[60] In December 2008, the entire cast and crew, including Khan, Madhavan, Joshi and Hirani, headed to Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore campus which served as Imperial College of Engineering. To prepare for the roles, the crew members stayed at the institution's dormitory blocks and at the college hostel.[citation needed] Though Khan saw the pictures of the location, he decided to see the location for real and wanted to stay at the hostel, in order to get through the role.[61] Khan regularly met the students during the morning and evenings and shared the experiences of studies and way of life. Apart from that, the team eventually mingled with the students while Khan also involved in many indoor and outdoor games.[62] While shooting for the film, the team made extra precautions with none of the shooting process might affect the routine class sessions.[60] It was the first film to be shot at the Indian Institutes of Management Group, and the university granted an academic pay-off for itself.[63] After shooting being completed the makers will film a documentary on the institution.[63] Few parts in Bangalore were doubled as New Delhi for the film. The entire shooting process was completed within February 2009.[citation needed] The entire film was shot in reverse, with the present-day scenes being shot first and the college scenes were shot later.[44] C. K. Muraleedharan was the cinematographer for 3 Idiots, after collaborating with Hirani for Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006). He used Arricam Lite (LT) camera for shooting the film, which consisted of Angenieux Optimo Anamorphic Lenses and Zeiss Master Prime Lenses, with the film had a distributed aspect ratio of 2.39:1.[citation needed] Rajkumar Hirani also undertook supervision of editing the film. For the scene where the leads get drunk and break in Virus' house, Aamir suggested that the actors might get drunk in reality so as to make it look convincing, but, however, the actors went on numerous retakes, which even led the stock of film roll being exhausted. The actors continued to do retakes, until the new rolls have been bought, so as to keep them busy.[64][65] The pregnancy scene was initially supposed to be placed in Hirani's debut film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003), but as he felt that the placement was irrelevant in the film, the team decided against doing so, and then was used in this film.[citation needed] The hospital scenes were shot at Fortis Hospital (Noida).[44] The film uses real inventions, with brains behind these innovations include Remya Jose, a student from Kerala, who created the pedal operated washing-machine;[11][66][67] Mohammad Idris, a barber from Hasanpur Kalan in Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, who invented a bicycle-powered horse clipper;[12] and Jahangir Painter, a painter from Maharashtra, who made the scooter-powered flour mill.[13] The character Phunsuk Wangdu drew inspiration from Ladakhi inventor Sonam Wangchuk, a mechanical engineering graduate from the National Institute of Technology, Srinagar.[14][68] The film's soundtrack is composed by Shantanu Moitra with lyrics penned by Swanand Kirkire. It marked Moitra's second consecutive collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani after Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), whose music album was successful.[69] Besides composing the songs, Moitra also composed the film score with Sanjay Wandrekar and Atul Raninga. The album was created with the inspiration of Moitra's college days, with the songs been written in consideration on the mindset of youngsters in India.[69] The album features five original compositions. Two tracks from the album were remixed, despite Moitra not liking the trend of remixing film songs.[70] Sonu Nigam rendered five out of seven tracks from the album. Other singers performing vocals to the songs are Shaan, Shreya Ghoshal, Suraj Jagan, Jaive Samsun, the lyricist Kirkire and composer Moitra themselves, recording for the soundtrack. One of the tracks \"Give Me Some Sunshine\" was sung by one of the lead actors, Sharman Joshi, in his maiden attempt in playback singing. The music album was released online (instead of a launch event),[71] by the film's official website on 27 November 2009,[72] with a video chat featuring the cast and crew members.[73] T-Series purchased the music rights of the film at an amount of ₹120 million (US$2.48 million).[74][75] The album received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Moitra's composition and the quality of the album.

We have the support of the local police so there is no question of going against the system. Piracy always existed in some form or the other. But we are getting the facts and figures only now as there are industry body who are working together to bring this menace in the forefront. To curb piracy in the long run we will have to constantly work towards means and ways to fight it.\"[124] The television rights of the film were purchased by Sony Pictures Networks for ₹22 crore (US$4.54 million), which was the highest bid during that time.[125] The film made its television debut on 25 July 2010, with promotions for the television premiere cost ₹2.2 lakh (US$4,811.25) and had attracted 12 popular sponsors to market the film.[126] It drew an audience of 39 million viewers in India,[18] and had attracted a TVR of 13.1 at the metro cities Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata and an overall TVR of 10.1 domestically.[127] The cumulative reach of the film was uplifted to 30.5%.[127] It also helped the broadcaster, Sony MAX to the third position among the general entertainment channels during that month.[128] On 27 August 2010, Reliance Big Entertainment launched the standard DVD and VCD editions of the film through Reliance Big Home Video.

Subhash K. Jha stated: \"It's not that 3 Idiots is a flawless work of art. But it is a vital, inspiring, and life-revising work of contemporary art with some heart imbued into every part. In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living. 3 Idiots does just that, and much more. The director takes the definition of entertainment into directions of social comment\".[136] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave it four and a half stars and suggests that, \"The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas […] Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, especially the childbirth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\"[137] Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave the film three and a half out of five stars and comments that \"this is the sort of movie you'll take home with a smile and a song on your lips.\"[138] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3 Idiots four and a half out of five stars and states: \"On the whole, 3 Idiots easily ranks amongst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favour: Watch 3 Idiots. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way.\"[139] Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave 3 Idiots five stars and argues that \"it's a lovely story, of a man from nowhere who wanted to learn, told like a fairy tale, with the secret heart carrying its coded message of setting all of us free.\"[140] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the film 3 stars and said \"Though a bit too calculated and designed, 3 Idiots is still an ok option for the significant message, interesting cast and scattered breezy moments.\"[141] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars and states: \"Going home after watching 3 Idiots I felt like I'd just been to my favorite restaurant only to be a tad underwhelmed by their signature dish. It was a satisfying meal, don't get me wrong, but not the best meal I'd been expecting.\"[142] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave it 3 stars, stating \"3 Idiots does not do as much for me. The emotional truth that shone through both the Munnabhai movies doesn't come through strongly enough.\"[143] Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film two out of five stars and states: \"Rajkumar Hirani's one of the directors of the decade, a man with immense talent and a knack for storytelling. On his debut, he hit a hundred. With his second, he hit a triple century. This time, he fishes outside the off stump, tries to play shots borrowed from other batters, and hits and misses to provide a patchy, 32*-type innings. It's okay, boss, chalta hai. Even Sachin has an off day, and we still have great hope.\"[144] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10.[145] Derek Elley of Variety wrote that \"3 Idiots takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half.\" Robert Abele of Los Angeles Times wrote that there's an \"unavoidable joie de vivre (symbolised by Rancho's meditative mantra 'All is well') and a performance charm that makes this one of the more naturally gregarious Bollywood imports.\" Louis Proyect described it as a \"fabulous achievement across the board. A typical Bollywood confection but also a social commentary on a dysfunctional engineering school system that pressures huge numbers of students into suicide.\"[24] The film was praised by critics in East Asia and Southeast Asia. South China Morning Post wrote that the film \"wraps a heavy message in light comedy. It is satire at its best, a powerful indictment of India's education system in which students cram for exams while stifling their dreams.\"[6] Chaerim Oh of KAIST Herald wrote that \"the film never harshly denounces the educational system but instead uncovers disturbing truths and unseen consequences of tremendous pressure upon students\" and that \"if you don't end up crying like I did (or won't admit that you did), you'll still enjoy the movie.\"[8] In Japan, Yuri Wakabayashi of Eiga also gave the film a positive review.[146] The film was made at the budget of ₹55 crore (US$11.36 million), while Indo-Asian News Service estimated the budget to be around ₹35–45 crore (US$4.6–6.0 million).[147] In August 2009, Reliance Big Pictures acquired the worldwide distribution rights of the film, along with the Hrithik Roshan-starrer Kites (2010) for ₹140 crore (US$28.92 million).[148] Individually, the worldwide theatrical rights were sold for about ₹65 crore (US$13.43 million).[147] After its theatrical run, the producers of the film negotiated deals with leading satellite television channels, with Sony Pictures Networks acquiring the film for ₹22 crore (US$4.54 million), a record during that period.[125] The music rights were sold to Super Cassettes Industries (T-Series) for ₹12 crore (US$2.48 million).[147] Excluding the print and advertisement costs, the film made a business ₹99 crore (US$20.45 million), even before the theatrical release.[147] The makers entered into tussles with the distributors as Khan insisted to sell the film's distribution rights at a tune of ₹100 crore (US$20.66 million); the distribution rights of the actor's previous film Ghajini (2008) was sold for ₹93 crore (US$21.38 million).[149][150] Following the financial turmoil, which affected the footfalls and earnings in multiplexes and single-screens, the stakeholders were not ready to buy the film for a huge amount, and reduce the price for distribution.[149] After much deliberations, the theatrical rights were being sold at a tune of ₹40–45 crore (US$5.3–6.0 million).[148] Reliance Big had also levied the deal to ₹20 crore (US$4.13 million) for home video release.[148] 3 Idiots, eventually topped online polls of the \"most-awaited film of the year\", with the extensive marketing campaign and pre-release contributed to it.[151] The advance bookings of

INOX Leisure Limited, stated that \"looking at the pre-release hype, the film will have the best openings of a movie this year in terms of theatrical revenues\",[83] while trade analyst Taran Adarsh stated that \"it could be easily one of the biggest blockbusters of the year\".[83] The film's worldwide lifetime gross was ₹460 crore (US$90 million),[a][17][18] making it the highest-grossing Indian film at the time.[155][156] The film was listed in Guinness World Records for the record of highest box office film gross for a Bollywood film.[157] As of 2020, the collections are equivalent to ₹980 crore (US$132.25 million), adjusted to inflation.[158] The success of the film was attributed to the content and the extensive pre-release promotions, which led to an increase in the huge number of footfalls.[147] The film created the highest collection record for paid previews with ₹2.75 crore that time, which was broken by Chennai Express (2013).[159] In its four-day first weekend, the film

period at cinemas in Taiwan, for more than two months from December 2010, breaking the record of Avatar (2009) with over NT$10 million (US$629,024)[165] grossed. 3 Idiots was the first aired Indian

weeks in December 2011,[91][15] eventually crossing the $3 million mark within a month, as of 5 January 2012.[174] Upon its release in the Japanese market in June 2013, it went on to collect around

In addition, 3 Idiots won the Grand Prize at the 4th Videoyasan Awards,[19][20] held by a Japanese organisation of home video retailers in 2014;[16] 3 Idiots was selected as 2013's best video release, beating thousands of films, anime and television shows,[20] including domestic Japanese and foreign Hollywood productions.[16] In 2023, Time Out ranked it 13th on its list of the \"100 Best Bollywood Movies.\"[180] The film is also considered among the best films made on friendship.[181][182] Film Companion added Omi Vaidya's character, in its \"50 Memorable Bollywood Characters\" list.[183] The film had a social impact on attitudes to education in Asia, including education in India.[25] The overwhelming success and impact in Indian society led to many authors and analysts to take a case study on the film and the message portrayed.[184][185] It was also noted for the \"realistic portrayal and depiction of universities, colleges and students\".[186][187] According to Jason Mecchi of Midstory, the film \"may have even played a role in the recent reorganization of the Indian education system, designed to reduce tedium and allow children to grow in multiple fields of study, rather than those that conform to a narrow idea of success.\"[188] The film has had a similar social impact on education in other Asian countries, including education in China.[7] Chinese universities were \"even prescribing the film in their coursework as a kind of stress-relief in their classrooms. The movie has served as a question bank for many local, family, zonal and national quizzes.\"[92] At the ninth edition of Chennai International Film Festival held in December 2011, Naichi Ho, the director of Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in New Delhi expressed about the phenomenal success of 3 Idiots, saying \"Five years ago no one in Taiwan watched Indian movies. The education system in our country is the same as in India. Every parent wants their children to go to the best school and there is a lot of pressure on the kids. So it's a hit among youngsters there\".[88] The unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) featured in the film was developed by Ankit Mehta, Rahul Singh and Ashish Bhat. This led to them receiving a $20 million contract to manufacture drones for the Indian Army.[189] The Nitesh Tiwari directorial Chhichhore (2019) has a resemblance to this film.[190] When 3 Idiots released in China, the country was only the 15th largest film market, partly due to China's widespread pirate DVD distribution at the time. However, it was the pirate market that introduced 3 Idiots to most Chinese audiences, becoming a cult film in the country among youths. Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result. By 2013, China grew to become the world's second-largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, with Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017).[191] In 2011, a documentary film titled Big in Bollywood was released, which revolves about Omi Vaidya's journey from a struggling Hollywood actor to a successful Bollywood breakthrough with this film.[192] As of 2017, 3 Idiots has been ranked China's 12th favourite film of all time according to ratings on popular Chinese film review site Douban, with only one domestic Chinese film (Farewell My Concubine) ranked higher.[191][193] The film holds an average rating of 9.2 on Douban,[193] with over 1.15 million votes.[194] As of 2021, the film is ranked at No. 14 on the list with mostly youth voting. On the Korean site Naver, audiences gave the film an average rating of 9.4/10,[8] and it is one of the top 30 highest-rated films on the site.[195] One reason for its success in East Asian markets such as China and Hong Kong is because of their similar education systems, thus many students were able to identify with the characters.[7] Chaerim Oh of KAIST Herald wrote that the \"popularity of the movie, particularly in South Korea, can be traced back to the national background of the overly competitive education system. In Korea, students of all ages – from young elementary children to university graduate students – are trained to study under overwhelming pressure and extremely high academic standards. In short, this movie is, really, our own story.\"[8] In 2013, Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg praised 3 Idiots, which he had seen three times and said he \"loved the emotional undertones.\" He listed it as one of five films that he connects with, along with The Godfather (1972) and his own work on E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Jaws (1975).[196] The Japanese anime series Gamers! (2017) references a scene from 3 Idiots, in the final episode of the series.[197] A poster of 3 Idiots appears in the Korean drama series Welcome to Waikiki (2018).[198] Shortly after the film's success, Gemini Film Circuit had purchased the remake rights of the film to be adapted in Tamil and Telugu-languages.[199] Shankar directing the Tamil version of the film, his first remake he worked on his career.[citation needed] After several considerations for the leads in the remake, the team approached Vijay, Srikanth and Jiiva to reprise the roles played by Khan, Madhavan and Joshi,[200] while Ileana D'Cruz essayed to reprise Kapoor's role from the film.[201] The film, which was titled as Nanban, released on 12 January 2012 to positive reviews.[26][27] For the Telugu remake, the team considered Ram Charan[202] for the titular role same disclosed by the actor in his speech of movie promotions in Hyderabad, but the project did not materialise.[203] Nanban was later dubbed in Telugu as Snehitudu and released two weeks after the original version.[204] The film was remade in Mexican Spanish-language named 3 idiotas and was released in May 2017.[28] A Hollywood-remake of this film was announced but did not come into fruition.[205] Initially, I did sit down with Raju and Abhijat while they were deciding to make a film based on '5 Point Someone'. I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time, and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in the USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that […] The film retains the soul of the book. 3 Idiots is different from the book but at the same time, it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film are coming from the book itself. And that's why the makers have officially credited the film as 'Based on a novel by Chetan Bhagat.' Chetan Bhagat, explaining about the novel's connection with the film, in an interview a day after its release.[citation needed] A controversy developed a few days after the release, however, over the fact that Chetan's credit, \"Based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat\" appeared in the closing credits rather than in the opening ones.[206] At that time, Bhagat stated that he \"was expecting an opening credit and I was quite surprised on not seeing it. They had bought the rights, made the payment, and committed to a credit in the contract. It's there, but it's not about it being there, it's about the placement and the prominence.\"[207] In a 31 December 2009 blog post on his personal website, Bhagat stated that he was told the movie was only 2–5% based on the book, but when he saw it, he felt that it was 70% of the book. He also argued that he was misled by the makers of the film, though he noted, that \"this has nothing to do with Mr. Aamir Khan […] I am a big fan of Aamir and he has made my story reach people. However, he was told by the makers not to read the book, and he hasn't. Thus, he cannot comment on the issue in a meaningful manner.\"[208] A few people responded to Chetan's statements. According to the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra clarified that \"in the agreement between the producer and Bhagat, it was clearly mentioned that the author's name would be put in the closing credits\".[209] IANS also reported that Chopra \"lost his cool\"[209] and \"asked a reporter to shut up after being questioned whether his hit 3 Idiots was lifted from author Chetan Bhagat's book Five Point Someone.\"[209] Chopra later apologised, stating: \"I really think I'm silly. I was provoked, but I shouldn't have done this. I saw myself on TV and saw how I was shouting 'shut up, shut up' like an animal. I told myself — 'what nonsensical behaviour'.\"[210] Aamir Khan also responded to these claims.[206][211] Rajkumar Hirani stated that \"We have officially bought the rights for the film. We drew a contract with him and it clearly mentions the position of his credit. With open eyes, he had seen the contract, consulted his lawyer, and signed the agreement […] In the contract, we have said that the title would be given in the rolling credits. We haven't changed the font size. We haven't increased the speed of the title. It's exactly there where it was agreed to be.\"[212] Chetan Bhagat later apologised stating, \"I definitely do not have anything against team 3 Idiots. I may have some issues with the mistake they may have made but nothing about their personality or the kind of people they are. I apologize to their families if there was any distress caused to them. I also want to thank all my fans, who stood by me but I don't want them to turn against anyone especially Aamir.\"[213] On 28 December 2010, the non-governmental organisation, Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education (CURE) co-founder Harsh Agarwal wrote a letter to the Raghavan Committee, a panel headed by former HRD Ministry R. K. Raghavan, explaining distress over a particular scene, where the lead actors gets ragged by seniors.[214] The organisation asked the committee to write a letter to the censor board to revisit and re-examine the particular scene.[214] The Bharatiya Janata Party, Maharashtra state spokesperson Madhav Bhandari demanded that the film should be sent for re-certification again in concern with that scene, after an incident in Seth G.S. Medical College inspired from the scene,[215][216] with the Chief minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan too demanded the same.[217] Aamir Khan however stated that the film is against \"ragging\".[215] In an article published in Economic and Political Weekly, Latika Gupta mentions that the film has serious problems when seen from the gender perspective, in particular, that it follows the trend set by the 2007 film Jab We Met in its use of women's sexual vulnerability to create sensation and humour. In one scene, students, professors, and the chief guest are seen bursting with laughter hearing a speech where the word balatkar (rape) figures 21 times and the word stan (breast) four times (in the English subtitles for international release, the words \"screwed\" and \"bosom\" are used instead).[218] When asked about plans of a 3 Idiots sequel in an interview with Hindustan Times, screenwriter Abhijat Joshi replied, saying, \"Honestly, I don't know. We have an idea for the 3 Idiots sequel, a Munna Bhai part three, and also for a PK sequel; but the PK and Munna Bhai sequels interest me the most. So, I think the 3 Idiots sequel may happen in the future, but these two I really want to work on.\"[219] In January 2016, director Rajkumar Hirani and actor Aamir Khan confirmed that they were considering a 3 Idiots sequel. Khan told reporters, \"Raju Hirani has given me a hint about 3 Idiots' sequel and I am giving you all a hint. The film will happen if and whenever he will write the script.\" Hirani agreed, saying \"this is one film that I really want to do.\"[220] In June 2018, Hirani was asked a question while promoting his upcoming film Sanju and he was quoted as saying, \"I definitely want to make a sequel to 3 Idiots, but it’s still in the initial stage and we will take a fair amount of time to develop the script\".[221] The report also said that Hirani will begin shooting for the Munna Bhai sequel with Sanjay Dutt. Work on 3 Idiots will begin only after Hirani is done with Munna Bhai 3.[222]\n"
