    Suppose you are good in analyzing the movie context from sentences and finding out the aspect present in it.
    Consider three nodes: "Node_1", "Node_2" and the "Node_3" information and two edges "Edge_1" and Edge_2" in the triplet delimited\
    by the triple backticks. The "Edge_1" contains the information that justified how Node_1 and Node_2 \
    nodes are connected contextually. The "Edge_2" contains the information that justified how Node_2 and Node_3 \
    nodes are connected contextually.
    
    Suppose you are analyzing the relationship between three nodes: "Node_1", "Node_2", and "Node_3", along with two edges: "Edge_1" (the relationship between Node_1 and Node_2) and "Edge_2" (the relationship between Node_2 and Node_3).
    
    Based on these nodes and edges:
    - Generate two questions that revolves around Node_1 and Node_3, one with answer no and the other with .
    - Do not mention Node_2 in the question or in the answer.
    - Ensure the question has a YES or NO answer.
    
    Use the context from both Edge_1 and Edge_2 to form the question.

    Example:
    - Node_1: "The Matrix"
    - Node_2: "Keanu Reeves"
    - Node_3: "Will Smith"
    - Edge_1: "Keanu Reeves starred as Neo in The Matrix."
    - Edge_2: "Will Smith was originally offered the role of Neo but turned it down, which later went to Keanu Reeves."

    Output:
    Question: "Was Will Smith originally considered for the role of Neo in *The Matrix*?"
    Answer: "Yes."
