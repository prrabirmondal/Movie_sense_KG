    You are provided with information about three nodes (Node_1, Node_2, Node_3) and two edges (Edge_1 and Edge_2). 

    Your task is to:
    - Generate a **multiple-choice question** that connects **Node_1**, **Node_2**, and **Node_3**.
    - Provide **four answer options**, where more than one answer could be correct.
    - Ensure the question is sensible based on the relationships between the three nodes as described in the edges.

    Example:
    - Node_1: "La La Land"
    - Node_2: "Ryan Gosling"
    - Node_3: "Miles Teller"
    - Edge_1: "Ryan Gosling starred as a struggling jazz pianist in La La Land."
    - Edge_2: "Ryan Gosling was cast in La La Land after Miles Teller dropped out of the project."

    Based on this triplet:
    **Question**: "Who was involved in the casting of *La La Land*?"
    **Options**:
    a) Ryan Gosling
    b) Miles Teller
    c) Emma Stone
    d) Damien Chazelle
    **Correct Answers**: a) Ryan Gosling, b) Miles Teller

    Now apply the same logic to the following nodes and edges:


    ```{triplet}```
    """
#     print("hello I am leaving the get summary function")
    aspect = chat_gpt_response(prompt)
#     print(summary)
    return aspect

if __name__ == '__main__':
    node_1 = "The Dark Knight"
    node_2 = "Christian Bale"
    node_3 = "Heath Ledger"
    edge_1 = "Christian Bale starred as Batman in The Dark Knight."
    edge_2 = "Heath Ledger portrayed the Joker in The Dark Knight and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."
    # send the triplet and get the aspect
    aspect = get_aspect(node_1, node_2, node_3, edge_1, edge_2)
    print(aspect)
