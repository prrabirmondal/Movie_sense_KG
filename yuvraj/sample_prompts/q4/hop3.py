   Suppose you are good at analyzing movie context from sentences and finding out the aspect present in them.
    Consider four nodes: "Node_1", "Node_2", "Node_3", and "Node_4" and three edges: "Edge_1", "Edge_2", and "Edge_3" in the triplet delimited by triple backticks.

    - "Edge_1" describes the relationship between Node_1 and Node_2.
    - "Edge_2" describes the relationship between Node_2 and Node_3.
    - "Edge_3" describes the relationship between Node_3 and Node_4.

    Your task is to analyze the relationships among all nodes based on the context provided by Edge_1, Edge_2, and Edge_3.

    - Generate a question that involves **both Node_1 and Node_4**.
    - Ensure the answer is **concise (2-3 words)** and is the **ONLY correct answer** based on the provided context.

    Example:
    - Node_1: "The Matrix"
    - Node_2: "Keanu Reeves"
    - Node_3: "Will Smith"
    - Node_4: "Tom Cruise"
    - Edge_1: "Keanu Reeves starred as Neo in The Matrix."
    - Edge_2: "Will Smith was originally offered the role of Neo but turned it down, which later went to Keanu Reeves."
    - Edge_3: "Tom Cruise was also considered for the role of Neo before Keanu Reeves was chosen."

    Output:
    Question: "Which actor, besides Keanu Reeves, was considered for the role of Neo in *The Matrix*?"
    Answer: "Tom Cruise."
